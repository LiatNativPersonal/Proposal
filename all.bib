@inproceedings{daume07implication,
	Abstract = {
    A standard form of analysis for linguistic typology is the universal
    implication.  These implications state facts about the range of extant
    languages, such as ``if objects come after verbs, then adjectives come
    after nouns.''  Such implications are typically discovered by
    painstaking hand analysis over a small sample of languages.  We
    propose a computational model for assisting at this process.  Our
    model is able to discover both well-known implications as well as some
    novel implications that deserve further study.  Moreover, through a
    careful application of hierarchical analysis, we are able to cope with
    the well-known sampling problem: languages are not independent.

	Abstract = {Abstract~~Polarized unification grammar (PUG) is a linguistic formalism which uses polarities to better control the way grammar fragments interact. The grammar combination operation of PUG was conjectured to be associative. We show that PUG grammar combination is not associative, and even attaching polarities to objects does not make it order-independent. Moreover, we prove that no non-trivial polarity system exists for which grammar combination is associative. We then redefine the grammar combination operator, moving to the powerset domain, in a way that guarantees associativity. The method we propose is general and is applicable to a variety of tree-based grammar formalisms. },

@article{Markman:1988,
	Abstract = {For children to acquire vocabulary as rapidly as they do, they must be able to eliminate many potential meanings of words. One way children may do this is to assume category terms are mutually exclusive. Thus, if a child already knows a label for an object, a new label for that object should be rejected. Six studies with 3-year-olds tested this hypothesis. Study 1 demonstrated that children reject a second label for an object, treating it, instead, as a label for a novel object. In the remaining studies, this simple novel label-novel object strategy was precluded. If the only object present is familiar, children cannot map a novel term to a novel object. Instead they must analyze the object for some other attribute to label. In Studies 2-6, children were taught either a new part term, e.g., trachea, or a new substance term, e.g., pewter, by showing them an object and saying, "This is a trachea" or ("It is pewter"). For unfamiliar objects, children tended to interpret the term as a label for the object itself. For familiar objects, they tended instead to interpret it as a part or substance term. Thus, mutual exclusivity motivates children to learn terms for attributes, substances, and parts as well as for objects themselves.},

@inproceedings{Calado03,
	Abstract = {This paper studies how link information can be used to
                   improve classification results for Web collections. We
                   evaluate four different measures of subject similarity,
                   derived from the Web link structure, and determine how
                   accurate they are in predicting document categories. Using
                   a Bayesian network model, we combine these measures with
                   the results obtained by traditional content-based
                   classifiers. Experiments on a Web directory show that best
                   results are achieved when links from pages outside the
                   directory are considered. Link information alone is able
                   to obtain gains of up to 46 points in F1, when compared to
                   a traditional content-based classifier. The combination
                   with content-based methods can further improve the
                   results, but too much noise may be introduced, since the
                   text of Web pages is a much less reliable source of
                   information. This work provides an important insight on
                   which measures derived from links are more appropriate to
                   compare Web documents and how these measures can be
                   combined with content-based algorithms to improve the
                   effectiveness of Web classification.},

@article{karlsson:2007b,
	Abstract = {The received view is that there are no constraints on clausal embedding complexity in sentences. This hypothesis will be challenged here on empirical grounds from the viewpoint of multiple initial embedding of clauses. The data come from the British National Corpus, Brown, LOB, and philological scholarship. The results extend to several other 'Standard Average European' (SAE) languages like Finnish, German, Latin, and Swedish. There is a precise quantitative constraint on the degree of initial clausal embedding, and that limit is two. In double initial embeddings, a qualitative constraint prescribes that typically the highest embedded clause is an <I>if</I>-clause. The lower embedded clause should be the sentential subject of the <I>if</I>-clause. Here is a real example of a maximally complex, prototypical, initial clausal embedding in mainstream SAE: [<SUB>Main</SUB> [<SUB>Init-1</SUB> <I>If</I> [<SUB>Init-2</SUB> <I>what is tantamount to dictatorship</I> &#8230;] <I>continues in a union</I>] <I>it can</I> &#8230;] (LOB). Multiple initial self-embeddings are prohibited.},

@article{lieven:etal:2003,
	Abstract = {The aim of the current study was to determine the degree to which a sample of one child's creative utterances related to utterances that the child previously produced. The utterances to be accounted for were all of the intelligible, multi-word utterances produced by the child in a single hour of interaction with her mother early in her third year of life (at age 2;1.11). We used a high-density database consisting of 5 hours of recordings per week together with a maternal diary for the previous 6 weeks. Of the 295 multi-word utterances on tape, 37\% were `novel' in the sense that they had not been said in their entirety before. Using a morpheme-matching method, we identified the way(s) in which each novel utterance differed from its closest match in the preceding corpus. In 74\% of the cases we required only one operation to match the previous utterance and the great majority of these consisted of the substitution of a word (usually a noun) into a previous utterance or schema. Almost all the other single-operation utterances involved adding a word onto the beginning or end of a previous utterance. 26\% of the novel, multi-word utterances required more than one operation to match the closest previous utterance, although many of these only involved a combination of the two operations seen for the single-operation utterances. Some others were, however, more complex to match. The results suggest that the relatively high degree of creativity in early English child language could be at least partially based upon entrenched schemas and a small number of simple operations to modify them. We discuss the implications of these results for the interplay in language production between strings registered in memory and categorial knowledge.},

We conducted a large-scale manual evaluation of 87 machine translation systems and 22 system combination entries. We used the ranking of these systems to measure how strongly automatic metrics correlate with human judgments of translation quality, for more than 20 metrics. We present a new evaluation technique whereby system output is edited and judged for correctness. },

	Abstract = {We propose to model the development of language by a series of formal grammars, accounting for the linguistic capacity of children at the very early stages of mastering language. This approach provides a testbed for evaluating theories of language acquisition, in particular with respect to the extent to which innate, language-specific mechanisms must be assumed. Specifically, we focus on a single child learning English and use the CHILDES corpus for actual performance data. We describe a set of grammars which account for this child's utterances between the ages&nbsp;1;8.02 and&nbsp;2;0.30. The coverage of the grammars is carefully evaluated by extracting grammatical relations from induced structures and comparing them with manually annotated labels. },

In the IPS, occurrences of 56 syntactic and morphological forms are counted, yielding a total score and subscores for noun phrases, verb phrases, questions/negations, and sentence structures. Data from 15 2-4 yr olds suggest that the IPS is a reliable and potentially valid method of evaluating the syntactic and morphological complexity of preschool language corpora. The IPS coding manual, which includes the 56 items, is appended. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved).}},

	Abstract = {Why do children learn nouns such as cup faster than dimensional adjectives such as big? Most explanations of this phenomenon rely on prior knowledge of the noun-adjective distinction or on the logical priority of nouns as the arguments of predicates. In this article we examine an alternative account, one which relies instead on properties of the semantic categories to be learned and of the word-learning task itself. We isolate four such properties: The relative size, the relative compactness, and the degree of overlap of the regions in representational space associated with the categories, and the presence or absence of lexical dimensions (what colour) in the linguistic context of a word. In a set of five experiments, we trained a simple connectionist network to label input objects in particular linguistic contexts. The network learned categories resembling nouns with respect to the four properties faster than it learned categories resembling adjectives.},

	Abstract = {This paper addresses possible interactive effects between word learning and syntax learning at an early stage of development. We present a computational model that simulates how the results from a syntax learning process and a word learning process can be integrated to build syntax-semantics mappings, and how the emergence of links between syntax and word learning could facilitate subsequent word learning. The central idea of our statistical model is to categorize words into groups based on their syntactic roles and then estimate semantic meanings of those syntactic categories using lexical knowledge acquired from a concurrent word learning process. Once built, those syntax-semantics mappings can be further utilized as a syntactic constraint in statistical word learning. We applied the model to realistic data collected from child-mother picture book reading interaction. A comparative study
between a statistical model and the model based on both statistical and syntactic information shows that syntactic cues can be seamlessly integrated in statistical learning and significantly improve word learning performance.},

@article{lieven:etal:1997,
	Abstract = {Pine \& Lieven (1993) suggest that a lexically-based positional analysis can account for the structure of a considerable proportion of children's early multiword corpora. The present study tests this claim on a second, larger sample of eleven children aged between 1;0 and 3;0 from a different social background, and extends the analysis to later in development. Results indicate that the positional analysis can account for a mean of 60\% of all the children's multiword utterances and that the great majority of all other utterances are defined as frozen by the analysis. Alternative explanations of the data based on hypothesizing underlying syntactic or semantic relations are investigated through analyses of pronoun case marking and of verbs with prototypical agent-patient roles. Neither supports the view that the children's utterances are being produced on the basis of general underlying rules and categories. The implications of widespread distributional learning in early language development are discussed.},

We carried out an extensive human evaluation which allowed us not only to rank the different MT systems, but also to perform higher-level analysis of the evaluation process. We measured timing and intra- and inter-annotator agreement for three types of subjective evaluation. We measured the correlation of automatic evaluation metrics with human judgments. This meta-evaluation reveals surprising facts about the most commonly used methodologies. },

    We present a method to transliterate names in the framework of
    end-to-end statistical machine translation.  The system is trained
    to learn when to transliterate.  For Ararbic to English MT, we
    developed and trained a transliterator on a bitext of 7 million
    sentences and Google's English terabyte ngrams and achieved better
    name translation accuracy than 3 out of 4 professional
    translators.  The paper also includes a discussion of challenges
    in name translation evaluation.

	Abstract = {We present a generative probabilistic model for the unsupervised learning of hierarchical natural language syntactic structure. Unlike most previous work, we do not learn a context-free grammar, but rather induce a distributional model of constituents which explicitly relates constituent yields and their linear contexts. Parameter search with EM produces higher quality analyses for human language data than those previously exhibited by unsupervised systems, giving the best published unsupervised parsing results on the ATIS corpus. Experiments on Penn treebank sentences of comparable length show an even higher constituent F1 of 71\% on non-trivial brackets. We compare distributionally induced and actual part-of-speech tags as input data, and examine extensions to the basic model. We discuss errors made by the system, compare the system to previous models, and discuss upper bounds, lower bounds, and stability for this task.},

                   Our new approach is based on a Bayesian network induction
                   which does not rely on some major assumptions found in a
                   previous method using the Bayesian independence classifier
                   approach. The design of the new approach as well as its
                   justification are presented. Experiments were conducted
                   using a large scale document collection from Reuters news
                   articles. The results show that our approach outperformed
                   the Bayesian independence classifier as measured by a
                   metric that combines precision and recall measures.},

The parsing model uses (i) multilingual word clusters and embeddings; (ii) token-level language information; and (iii) language-specific features (fine-grained POS tags). This input representation enables the parser not only to parse effectively in multiple languages, but also to generalize across languages based on linguistic universals and typological similarities, making it more effective to learn from limited annotations. Our parser's performance compares favorably to strong baselines in a range of data scenarios, including when the target language has a large treebank, a small treebank, or no treebank for training.},

abstract="This article focuses on the variability of one of the subtypes of multi-word expressions, namely those consisting of a verb and a particle or a verb and its complement(s). We build on evidence from Estonian, an agglutinative language with free word order, analysing the behaviour of verbal multi-word expressions (opaque and transparent idioms, support verb constructions and particle verbs). Using this data we analyse such phenomena as the order of the components of a multi-word expression, lexical substitution and morphosyntactic flexibility.",

abstract="Recent work in computational linguistics points out the need for systems to be sensitive to the veracity or factuality of events as mentioned in text; that is, to recognize whether events are presented as corresponding to actual situations in the world, situations that have not happened, or situations of uncertain interpretation. Event factuality is an important aspect of the representation of events in discourse, but the annotation of such information poses a representational challenge, largely because factuality is expressed through the interaction of numerous linguistic markers and constructions. Many of these markers are already encoded in existing corpora, albeit in a somewhat fragmented way. In this article, we present FactBank, a corpus annotated with information concerning the factuality of events. Its annotation has been carried out from a descriptive framework of factuality grounded on both theoretical findings and data analysis. FactBank is built on top of TimeBank, adding to it an additional level of semantic information.",

doi = {10.1162/COLI\_a\_00096},
abstract = { Identifying the veracity, or factuality, of event mentions in text is fundamental for reasoning about eventualities in discourse. Inferences derived from events judged as not having happened, or as being only possible, are different from those derived from events evaluated as factual. Event factuality involves two separate levels of information. On the one hand, it deals with polarity, which distinguishes between positive and negative instantiations of events. On the other, it has to do with degrees of certainty (e.g., possible, probable), an information level generally subsumed under the category of epistemic modality. This article aims at contributing to a better understanding of how event factuality is articulated in natural language. For that purpose, we put forward a linguistic-oriented computational model which has at its core an algorithm articulating the effect of factuality relations across levels of syntactic embedding. As a proof of concept, this model has been implemented in De Facto, a factuality profiler for eventualities mentioned in text, and tested against a corpus built specifically for the task, yielding an F1 of 0.70 (macro-averaging) and 0.80 (micro-averaging). These two measures mutually compensate for an over-emphasis present in the other (either on the lesser or greater populated categories), and can therefore be interpreted as the lower and upper bounds of the De Facto's performance. }

                  suggests that emotions have an influence on human
                  behavior. Nonetheless, we still know very little
                  about the emotional states of those actors whose
                  daily decisions have a lasting impact on our
                  societies: politicians in parliament. We address
                  this question by making use of methods of natural
                  language processing and a digitized corpus of text
                  data spanning a century of parliamentary debates in
                  the United Kingdom. We use this approach to examine
                  changes in aggregate levels of emotional polarity in
                  the British parliament, and to test a hypothesis
                  about the emotional response of politicians to
                  economic recessions. Our findings suggest that,
                  contrary to popular belief, the mood of politicians
                  has become more positive during the past decades,

	in terms of certainty and speculation. Next, the proportions of these lexical

	regression model. Subsequently, lexical cue proportions, predicted certainty,
	as well as their time course characteristics are used to compute veracity for
	each rumor in terms of the identity of the rumor-resolving tweet and its binary
	resolution value judgment. The system operates without access to
	extralinguistic resources. Evaluated on the data portion for which hand-labeled
	examples were available, it achieves .74 F1-score on identifying rumor
	resolving tweets and .76 F1-score on predicting if a rumor is resolved as true

    abstract = { Scientific Narrative Psychology integrates quantitative methodologies into the study of identity. Its methodology, Narrative Categorical Analysis, and its toolkit, NarrCat, were both originally developed by the Hungarian Narrative Psychology Group. NarrCat is for machine-made transformation of sentences in self-narratives into psychologically relevant, statistically processable narrative categories. The main body of this flexible and comprehensive system is formed by Psycho-Thematic modules, such as Agency, Evaluation, Emotion, Cognition, Spatiality, and Temporality. The Relational Modules include Social References, Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), and Negation. Certain elements can be combined into Hypermodules, such as Psychological Perspective and Spatio-Temporal Perspective, which allow for even more complex, higher level exploration of composite psychological processes. Using up-to-date developments of corpus linguistics and Natural Language Processing (NLP), a unique feature of NarrCat is its capacity of SRL. The structure of NarrCat, as well as the empirical results in group identity research, is discussed. }

 abstract = {Our use of language embodies attitudes as well as referential meanings. 'Woman's language' has as foundation the attitude that women are marginal to the serious concerns of life, which are pre-empted by men. The marginality and powerlessness of women is reflected in both the ways women are expected to speak, and the ways in which women are spoken of. In appropriate women's speech, strong expression of feeling is avoided, expression of uncertainty is favored, and means of expression in regard to subject-matter deemed 'trivial' to the 'real' world are elaborated. Speech about women implies an object, whose sexual nature requires euphemism, and whose social roles are derivative and dependent in relation to men. The personal identity of women thus is linguistically submerged; the language works against treatment of women, as serious persons with individual views. These aspects of English are explored with regard to lexicon (color terms, particles, evaluative adjectives), and syntax (tag-questions, and related aspects of intonation in answers to requests, and of requests and orders), as concerns speech by women. Speech about women is analyzed with regard to lady: woman, master: mistress, widow: widower, and Mr: Mrs., Miss, with notice of differential use of role terms not explicitly marked for sex (e.g. professional) as well.

abstract="Effects of gender and gender-typing on communication styles were examined in 62 male and 110 female college students. Participants were asked to rate the likelihood of giving certain responses to a friend's problems as well as the likelihood of feeling certain emotions when a friend gives them advice or sympathy for their own problems. Men and masculine people were expected to be more likely to respond to a friend in a way that reduces interpersonal intimacy; women and feminine people were expected to respond in a way that enhances interpersonal intimacy. Although a few gender differences were found, participants' level of expressive/nurturing traits (``femininity'') was related to more responses than was gender. The importance of examining gender-linked traits and not just gender when studying communication patterns is emphasized.",

on the spontaneous linguistic productions of advanced non-native speakers.
Introducing a large corpus of highly competent non-native English speakers,
and using a set of carefully selected lexical items, we show that the
lexical choices of non-natives are affected by cognates in their native
language. This effect is so powerful that we are able to reconstruct the
phylogenetic language tree of the Indo-European language family solely from
the frequencies of specific lexical items in the English of authors with
various native languages. We quantitatively analyze non-native lexical
choice, highlighting cognate facilitation as one of the important phenomena
shaping the language of non-native speakers.},

abstract="One of online social networks' best marketing strategies is viral advertisement. The influence of users on their friends can increase or decrease sales, so businesses are interested in finding influential people and encouraging them to create positive influence. Models and techniques have been proposed to facilitate finding influential people, however most fail to address common online social network problems such as fake friends, spammers and inactive users. We propose a method that uses interaction between social network users to detect the most influential among them. We calculate the relationship strength and influence by capturing the frequency of interactions between users. We tested our model in a simulated social network of 150 users. Results show that our model succeeds in excluding spammers and inactive users from the calculation and in handling fake friendships.",

Abstract = {This volume offers a cross-disciplinary insight into language contact research, bringing together fresh empirical and theoretical studies from various fields concerning different dimensions of language contact and variation, second language acquisition and translation. In the present-day world of globalization, population mobility and information technology, the themes of multilingualism and contact-induced language change are as topical as ever, and research on language contacts and cross-linguistic influence has expanded rapidly during the last few decades. Along with the increasing specialization of related disciplines, their research perspectives, methods and terminology have become dispersed, although language contact phenomena themselves can rarely be confined within the scope of a single discipline. This collection of articles creates dialogue between researchers from different scientific backgrounds, thus viewing language contact phenomena from a broader perspective. When lang},

    abstract = { In standard NLP pipelines, morphological analysis and disambiguation (MA\&D) precedes syntactic and semantic downstream tasks. However, for languages with complex and ambiguous word-internal structure, known as morphologically rich languages (MRLs), it has been hypothesized that syntactic context may be crucial for accurate MA\&D, and vice versa. In this work we empirically confirm this hypothesis for Modern Hebrew, an MRL with complex morphology and severe word-level ambiguity, in a novel transition-based framework. Specifically, we propose a joint morphosyntactic transition-based framework which formally unifies two distinct transition systems, morphological and syntactic, into a single transition-based system with joint training and joint inference. We empirically show that MA\&D results obtained in the joint settings outperform MA\&D results obtained by the respective standalone components, and that end-to-end parsing results obtained by our joint system present a new state of the art for Hebrew dependency parsing. }
